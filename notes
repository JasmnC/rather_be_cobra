What is Python's main characteristic regarding syntax compared to other programming languages?
- writing: syntax no ;(semicolon) and {}(curly braces), indentation matters
           variables dynamically typed
- compile and run: interpreter to execute the code and directly gets compiled into machine code
                   automatic garbage collection
- community and supports: simple to learn and write, more Data/ML modules,packages, libraries

What are the basic data types available in Python?
- numeric: int, float, complex
- text: str
- boolean: bool
- multiples: list, tuple, set, dict
- others: bytes, bytearray, memoryview, NoneType
* mixing data type, you get TypeError

Why is indentation important in Python?
- writing: it's a syntax requirement, it defindes code block
           readability, consistency, reduce ambiguilty
- if not follow, we'll get IndentationError or TabError

What happens when you try to mix incompatible data types in an operation?
- TypeError

What is Git Flow?
- it's a branching model
- helps manage development and release cycle
- branches: main (<->hotfix) <- release <- develop (<-> feature)

Operation == vs is 
- checks values <-> checks referencce/memory


Implicit vs explicit type conversion
- automatic by compiler <-> by casting(by programmer)

What's the difference between if x: and if x == True:?
- concept of True-eveluating
- for boolean type the same, for non-boolean type, if x first convert x into it's boolean equivalent
- True: numerics not 0, multiples not empty, not None
