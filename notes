What is Python's main characteristic regarding syntax compared to other programming languages?
- writing: syntax no ;(semicolon) and {}(curly braces), indentation matters
           variables dynamically typed
- compile and run: interpreter to execute the code and directly gets compiled into machine code
                   automatic garbage collection
- community and supports: simple to learn and write, more Data/ML modules,packages, libraries

What are the basic data types available in Python?
- numeric: int, float, complex
- text: str
- boolean: bool
- multiples: list, tuple, set, dict
- others: bytes, bytearray, memoryview, NoneType
* mixing data type, you get TypeError

Why is indentation important in Python?
- writing: it's a syntax requirement, it defindes code block
           readability, consistency, reduce ambiguilty
- if not follow, we'll get IndentationError or TabError

What happens when you try to mix incompatible data types in an operation?
- TypeError

What is Git Flow?
- it's a branching model
- helps manage development and release cycle
- branches: main (<->hotfix) <- release <- develop (<-> feature)

Operation == vs is 
- checks values <-> checks referencce/memory


Implicit vs explicit type conversion
- automatic by compiler <-> by casting(by programmer)

What's the difference between if x: and if x == True:?
- concept of True-eveluating

Immutable                           vs mutable data types
- int, float, bool, string         <-> list, set, dict
- quick access, cheaper in storage <-> flexible, recommended

List vs tuple
- list advantage: mutable, list-specific operations(ex: append, extend, remove)
- tuple advantage: immutability -> memory efficientcy, iteration speed(sort in concecetive blocks)

List operation:
- list.append(x) for adding one single element at the end
- list.extend([x,x]) adds an intereable at the end
- list.insert(i,x) adds one element to specific index

* Explain the difference between shallow copy and deep copy between `list.copy()`, `list[:]`, and `copy.deepcopy()`
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of using set comprehensions vs converting a list comprehension to a set?
* What's the time complexity difference between checking membership (`in` operator) in a list vs a set?
* Why are tuples immutable but you can still modify a list inside a tuple?
* What will `my_list[::2]`, `my_list[::-1]`, and `my_list[1::3]` return for `my_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`?
* What's the difference between `remove()`, `pop()`, and `del` for lists?
- for boolean type the same, for non-boolean type, if x first convert x into it's boolean equivalent
- True: numerics not 0, multiples not empty, not None
